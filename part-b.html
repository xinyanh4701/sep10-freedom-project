                        <p>The Holographic Watch, a wearable on your hand with its modern, simple, and sleek design. The smartwatch displays a holographic app after you tap the side of the watch. Displaying in a 16:10 aspect ratio, the holographic app consists of all the public transportation information you need. Here are some of the information the app provides:
                        <ul>
                           <li>What transportation vehicles are arriving or departing</li> 
                           <li>What time is it?</li>
                           <li>What public transportation stations are near my location?</li>
                           <li>What public transportation services are available?</li>
                           <li>When is the next stop or what is that stop called?</li>
                           <li>How much time do you have to wait for the vehicle to arrive?</li>
                           <li>A map of your surroundings</li>
                           <li>Personal Information</li>
                        </ul>
                        One feature the Holographic Watch offers is the wake up alarm system. The purpose of this feature is to wake passengers up to help them reach their destination. The smartwatch uses sensors to detect the heart rate of your body to see if you are asleep or taking a nap. The first stage of the wake up alarm system is the watch will send small vibrations to the passenger to wake them up. If the passenger is still not responding, the Holographic watch will alarm the person using alarm sounds and small vibrations. If the person is still asleep, a notification will be sent to neighboring passengers to help the asleep person wake up.

                        <p>One of the biggest issues in public transportation is crowdness. In order to combat this issue, I came up with the Limac. Operators of the public transportation system only get to use this device since it's not for passenger use. The Limac should be placed in a high altitude, so the device could detect a massive area. Using cameras, lidar, and motion sensors, this device detects how many people are waiting for the vehicle to arrive. If the device shows that there are excessive amount of passengers in one station, there are two options to solve the issue (all of them will still go to the same route): 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have standby vehicles that are ready to carry some of the passengers</li>
                            <li>The vehicle that is closest to the destination would make an express. For example, if a train is 5 minutes away from the crowded station and there are not a lot of passengers between the crowded station and the stop the vehicle is at, then, the train would tell the passengers to leave if they are not going to the crowded station. The train would go straight to the crowded station. The train behind the express train would have to pick up the pace.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The Limac would also collect data on how many passengers use the transportation often. If there are a lot of passengers using the station at a certain time, then the vehicle's arrival schedule would change according to the data.
                        </p>

                        This next invention idea is also only used by the operators. CAT, a device located outside of the vehicle, preferably next to the doors, detects if people are going to ride or depart the vehicle. CAT lets the drivers or conductors know if people are still getting in or out of the vehicle. This device will reduce injuries or property damage. Here's why:
                        <ul>
                            <li>When elderly people get off the vehicle, the driver or operator might close the doors when the person is still getting out. That may cause injuries to the eldery or people with difficulties getting around since they are more prone to injuries. This issue also applies to fragile objects or animals who are prone to injuries as well.</li>
